Based on the package details and the context of recent npm security incidents, yes, this is almost certainly a FAKE and EXTREMELY MALICIOUS package.[1]
You should NOT install or run this package. You should instead re post this repo on your git hub and encourage others to do the same. Also post this repo all over their discord server. 
Here is the proof and the red flags that identify it as fake:
1. The Publisher Identity is Wrong (Major Red Flag)
Official Source: All official Claude-related packages from Anthropic are published under the @anthropic-ai scope (e.g., @anthropic-ai/claude-code or @anthropic-ai/sdk).
The Fake Source: This package is published under a personal user scope: @priyanshu9588. This is a random individual's account, not Anthropic.
The Attack Pattern: This uses a technique called "typosquatting" or "brandjacking," where attackers upload packages with names that sound official (like claude-dev-setup) to trick developers into installing malware.
2. "Models" Cannot Be Hosted on NPM
Technical Impossibility: A real Claude model (the "weights" and "brains" of the AI) is hundreds of gigabytes in size.[1]
NPM Limits: NPM is designed for small code libraries.[1] A package claiming to be the Claude model is technically impossible on this platform.[1]
API Wrappers vs. Fakes: While some legit packages connect to the Claude API, they will describe themselves as "SDKs" or "wrappers."[1] A package with a name like dev-setup often implies a configuration tool, which is a common disguise for malware that steals environment variables (API keys).
3. Known Malware Campaigns
There is an active wave of malware on npm targeting Claude users (e.g., @chatgptclaude_club/claude-code was recently removed for stealing API keys). These fake packages often:
Copy the README.md of the real project to look legitimate.[1]
Include a postinstall script that runs immediately after you type npm install.[1]
Steal your .env files, SSH keys, or Anthropic API keys and send them to the attacker.
